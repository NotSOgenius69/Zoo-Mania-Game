<h2>Introduction:</h2>
Assalam-u-alaikum everyone.


So I built a really fun game named "Zoo Mania".It is basically a card matching game but a little different then the normal ones.


<h2>Theme:</h2>
Here we have to match the card of the animals to catch them. But the twist is that snake and scorpion cards will reduce health if we can't match them after opening them and will swap position with a random hidden card, which makes the game more interesting. If the player is able to match all the cards before his/her health reduces to zero he/she wins otherwise loses.

<h2>Languages used:</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
</ul>
<h3>HTML:</h3>
So I built the basic structure of the game using html.For this project I used different html tags and elements.
Among them  most frequents are:
<ol type='1'>
<li>div</li>
<li>img</li>
<li>p</li>
<li>span</li>
<li>button</li>
</ol>
I also used classes and ids to group them or identify elements uniquely.
<h3>CSS:</h3>
CSS played a major part in the design.I designed and decorated the whole thing using css.
I used basic class selector and id selector to design individual elements.Besides to align items in a proper way I used two important tools of CSS:
<ul>
<li>Flexbox</li>
<li>Grid</li>
</ul>
I used these two tools to design a proper layout for the game.Furthermore I've added a little bit of animations too in some of the elements.
<h3>Javascript:</h3>
All the logics,calculations,events and decisions were implemented through javascript.
Concepts of Javascript that I used in my project:
<ol type='1'>
<li>Array</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>eventHandler</li>
<li>loop</li>
<li>if else-if</li>
</ol>
I hope everyone will find the game enjoyable and fun. And don't forget to give your feedback on how you liked the game and how can i improve it more or report any bug.
<h1>Enjoy!!!</h1>
